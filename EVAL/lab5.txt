9.5/10

BMR:
Good. But those function prototypes need be above the main(), just like those "#include ..." above the main()  in Figures with multiple files. 

Figures: 
In the figuresInput: we can have #include "figures.h" directly rather than #include "figures.cpp".

The header file, figures.h, is protected against multiple inclusion.
